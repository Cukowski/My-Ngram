# Welcome to My Ngram

---

Hello and welcome to My Ngram project.

I will show you how I completed this project.

## Task

The problem is write a code that is able to tell me the numbers of characters we used in a string.

My Ngram will be calculated through this app.

## Description

To solve this problem, I check my old notes try to find similar projects I did in my past.

You can see I used simple logic too.

## Installation

You can download my project from Gitea. I am git adding the project to the server.

All you need to do is use a terminal or console.

## Usage

This project mostly uses the basic functions and some math equations, if you read my comments in program I am confident you can understand how it all works.

```
./my_project argument1 argument2
//my_ngram project is using an input
```

Just put the necessary inputs and you will recieve the desired result.
